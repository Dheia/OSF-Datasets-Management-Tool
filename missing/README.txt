A series of files will get created in this folder. For each synchronized dataset, DSF will report any properties, or classes, that are being used in these datasets and that are not defined in the ontologies currently used in the structWSF instance.

These should be considered warnings, and can be added to the ontologies once the dataset are synchronized.
